-- Retail Bug --
This is same case as on retail, where they don't scale. The buff & debuff tooltips don't take into account any talents/glyphs, so they will always show the default amount.

You can check the correct amount in your action bar/spellbook tooltip.

Closed.

-- Already working on PTR --
This works fine on PTR.

Loth will review it and applies the fix from the PTR to the live realm soon. Thank you for the report.

I would like to ask you and everyone else to _**not**_ consider other private server projects as source of information. The only valid source is retail (3.X.X) and sites that directly extract information from there like wowhead and wowwiki.

QUEST REACCEPT - ITEMS
Yes you can fix that issue by yourself. Just remove the quest from your questlog. (Don't worry the items will still be in your bag). Then reaccept the quest, and then you can directly complete it. Thank you.

REPRODUCE
I cannot confirm this on PTR. The creatures follows the player as it should. Also after every respawn it follows the player. 
If you could give me more details or a way to reproduce the issue, i will reinspect it. Thanks. Setting the issue on HOLD for now until we can reproduce it.
